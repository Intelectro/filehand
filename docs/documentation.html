<p>The following are notes, comments, references on things done or to be done to implement functionalities, solve problems, fix bugs and in general improve this site.</p>
<p><strong>Feature: Downloading to the server an image from a URL and adding it to an image field in the database</strong> <br />Suppose you want to use an image you found on the web as part of the content of a document in your site. If you reference the URL directly and the image is pulled from a non-encrypted source, browsers will complain about your site's SSL being compromised. Even if the source is encrypted, the image may disappear at any time. So I want my site to have a page where you can give it an image's URL and the name you want to assign to the image, and it will download the image to the server in a predefined location, and add it to an image field of a predefined table in the database. Search: "django how grab an image from a url and save". See: <a href="http://ishcray.com/downloading-and-saving-image-to-imagefield-in-django">http://ishcray.com/downloading-and-saving-image-to-imagefield-in-django</a></p>
<p><strong>Bug: In some situations I get a Forbidden (403) CSRF verification failed. Request aborted. error when logging in.</strong><br /> I think it happens when I have been logged out due to idle timeout and then I try to log in from the same page where I was when session expired. Search: "django CSRF verification failed. Request aborted. when logging in".
